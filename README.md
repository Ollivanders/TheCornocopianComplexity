Abstract —
Context/Background - The increasing commercial success of video games is matched only by the
difficulty in developing them, therefore it has become fashionable to incorporate Procedural Content Gen- eration (PCG) into game design to meet growing end-user demand for a clean, polished, yet intricate final product, while remaining within production constraints. However, developing game composition programmatically yields the issue of ensuring output appropriately conveys the message and recreational experience intended for the player by a developer, culminating from inability of algorithms too effectively identify desirable content.

Aims - The project aims to combine existing methodologies into an executable game environment that produces level structures based on PCG. The program must accept a developer’s/computer’s choice from unified criteria that directly inspire the resulting generation, thus having randomised features that embolden characteristics initially specified. An evaluation process will then breakdown level physiog- nomy to encourage either manual or automatic influence over the current generation or the following one, granting levels a greater visceral meaning and designers a simplified design process.

Method - The implementation will utilise an intelligent model, building upon established grammar centralised methods that inaugurate rules fixating on a set of user provided seeds, followed by controlled randomisation of an enclosed environment against a graphical representation extracted from encapsulated attributes. Automated evaluation follows, providing numerical analytics for a particular set of friendly constraints during level progression or lending the model as inspiration for alternative game structures.

Results - The program distinctively incorporates a unique blend of techniques into a system that produces level content on-demand and internally/externally from a game engine, offering convenience for both a developer and end-user. Parameter specification grants individuals an uncommon precedent, while maintaining evolved, visual and intuitive variety within portrayals.

Conclusions - The combined approach utilising the benefits of random geometric level design and graphical grammars gives a developer valued control over incidental game design, while facilitating scope for diverse content to appear. Offering vast improvements over rudimentary procedural designs, the methodology is, however a relatively expensive process that requires careful application to reap full benefits in incidental level composition and as a developer assistant.
